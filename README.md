# L A U E S I M
Simulate diffraction from crystals using divergent chromatic X-rays and flat detectors.

This is a toy sientific project to gain a better understanding of the so called Laue Diffraction geometry in which a divergent and white beam of X-rays is allowed to illuminate a polycrytsal giving rise to diffraction that is recorded on a flat 2d area detector.
